<!-- Enumerates all available channels from the Motion Service configurable data stream. It is not required to enumerate all channels in your client definition. The hierarchy in this example file illustrates which channels are activated by which parent node. The <all> node denotes that all child channels are enabled. Its children, <preview>, <sensor>, and <raw> in turn denote that all child channels are enabled. <Gq> enables <Gqw>, <Gqx>, <Gqy>, and <Gqz> All real valued elements specified in IEEE-754 single precision binary floating point format (binary32), little-endian byte order. All integral value elements specified in 16-bit signed integer two's complement format (short), little endian byte order. @file tools/configurable.xml @author Luke Tokheim, luke@motionnode.com @version 2.2 (C) Copyright Motion Workshop 2015.

<!-- Root element with preferences defined as attributes. stride: Skip frames to slow data rate handled by client. For example, set stride="2" to halve the frame rate exported to the client. full: Full data stream read direct from hardware device to client. Set to "1" to enable full mode. The default data stream will drop samples if the client falls behind to preserve the hardware connection. inactive: Read back data for all nodes in the configuration, even if they are not associated with an actual sensor. Set to "1" to enable inactive mode. This is intended for clients that want to access interpolated node orientations or positions for every node. -->
